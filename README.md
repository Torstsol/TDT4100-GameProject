GameProject TDT4100 - Spring 2017

This is a fully functioning Dance-Dance revolution clone made from scratch using Java with the Jframe-library.
It was made by Torstein Solberg and Andreas Arnholm over the course of a couple of weeks as an entry to the 
Game Project in the course TDT4100 Objectoriented programming at NTNU, Trondheim 2017. It won two awards, 
"Most Adictive game 2017" and "Best Game 2017".

The game features multiple maps/songs, difficulties and a Highscore. 

Disclamer:
This whas created when our comprehension of Git was minimal, we had to rebase and the comments are complete trash.
